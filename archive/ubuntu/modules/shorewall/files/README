1.  Puppet install shorewall default configurations when
	defaults_installed is missing only

3.  We want to update shorewall rules file based on node type (hostname prefix):
	rules_hostname.domain.example.com  (this is for special cases only, use RARELY if EVER)
	rules_hostname.environment  (this is for dev, test mostly and ONLY when diff from stage/prod)
	rules_nodetype  (this should be default for prod and stage)
